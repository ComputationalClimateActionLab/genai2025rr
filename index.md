In this research retreat, we aim to investigate how generative AI—especially Large Language Models—can be integrated with approaches like Agent-Based Modeling to study complex social and socio-ecological dynamics. This method offers an alternative to large-scale field experiments and may provide deeper insights into phenomena such as social tipping, sustainable transitions, and the cascading socio-economic and socio-political impacts of climate change.
