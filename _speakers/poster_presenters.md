**Development and Application of the MultiSEp R Package to Identify Multiple Myeloma  Achilles' Heels for Drug Discovery.**
Speaker: Adeline McKie
Authors: Adeline McKie, Mark Wappett, Lisa Crawford, Ian Overton.

Achilles' heel relationships arise when the status of one gene exposes a cell's vulnerability to perturbation of a second gene, such as chemical inhibition, providing opportunities for precision oncology. The MultiSEp algorithm was developed to interrogate mutually exclusive loss signatures in multiomics data. While there is significant focus on genetic approaches, transcriptome data has advantages for investigation of GDRs and remains relatively underexplored. MultiSEp performs unsupervised assignment of cell lines into gene expression clusters, providing for partitioning of CRISPR scores and mutational status in order to propose candidate GDRs. A total of 60-unit tests were developed and applied to the MultiSEp R package, which includes functionality to discover patterns characteristic of synthetic lethality. Almost all Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients relapse and succumb to therapy-resistant disease; accordingly, more effective treatments are urgently needed.  We predicted MM GDRs by MultiSEp analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq) from the CoMMpass study (n=859 patients) to generate an all vs all gene dependency network of 372,303,828 edges (n=27,288 genes). Statistical filtering and GDR pattern analysis produced a high confidence predicted synthetic lethality network (8,695 edges, 5059 genes). Analysis of the predicted MM GDR network revealed individual ‘nexus’ genes where the neighbourhood of genes were collectively mutated in a relatively high proportion of MM patients, representing attractive drug targets. Further filtering adds confidence to predicted therapeutic targets including assessment of the impact of mutations on protein function and predicted population coverage. Results identified context-specific biochemical interactions, illuminating fundamental biology, for example around the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System. The MultiSEp R package is soon to be available from CRAN.
