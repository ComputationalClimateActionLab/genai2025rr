Dr. Max Falkenberg is a computational social scientist and Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Network and Data Science at the Central European University in Vienna, Austria. He also holds a Visiting Fellow position in the Inverse Complexity Group at IT:U in Linz, Austria, and in the Institute for Sustainable Resources at UCL. He completed his PhD in Physics at Imperial College London in 2022 and a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at City, University of London in 2024.

His research applies network science to problems in computational social science. He is particularly interested in studying the structural underpinnings of political polarisation, climate communication and politics, and climate finance. He has published multiple peer-reviewed papers, including in Nature Climate Change, Nature Communications (climate finance, polarization), PNAS Nexus, PLOS Climate Change, Physical Review E, Physical Review Research, Communications Physics, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, amongst others. He has also contributed to a report published at COP28 on climate tipping points, and released a dataset (ICWSM'24) for the Indian microblogging platform Koo. He regularly acts as an academic reviewer, including for Nature Human Behaviour, One Earth, PNAS Nexus, EPJ Data Science, PLOS One, Communications Physics, Scientific Reports, Royal Society Open Science, and others.
