David Garcia is professor for Social and Behavioural Data Science at the University of Konstanz since 2022 and Faculty Member of the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. He is a member of the Extended Directorate of the Centre for Human Data Society at the University of Konstanz since October 2022. He studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and ETH Zürich. In 2009 he earned his master ‘s degree (thesis: Analysis of higher-order structures of equilibrium networks), followed by the doctorate in 2012 (thesis: Modeling collective emotions in online communities). He obtained his habilitation in Computational Social Sciences in 2018 at the ETH Zürich (thesis: Understanding Emotions and Social Interactions in the Digital Society). David Garcia has expert knowledge in Computational Social Science investigating human behavior through digital traces with methods from complexity science. Analyzing big social data by using computational modeling, he aims to understand the impact of line media and social media networks on individuals and society (e.g. inequalities, data privacy).
