Joao Pinheiro Neto is a physicist with experience in computational social science. He focuses on comparing different social media platforms, aiming to understand what makes them tick. He believes that data-driven toy models can help design social media platforms that are better and more resilient to manipulation by bad actors. He also believes that timely research can influence decision-making and ultimately pressure platforms into design decisions that do more than blindly chase engagement metrics.

His approach involves large-scale data collection, as well as analysis and modeling using techniques from physics, statistics, and machine learning. In particular, he currently focuses on large language models as both objects of research (their impact on social media) and as tools for simulating and analyzing social media content.

He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the IDea_Lab at the University of Graz, under Prof. Jana Lasser. An up-to-date list of his publications can be found on Google Scholar.
