Research interests:

Milena’s research interests lie in the fields of computational and experimental social science. She is the director of the HUMANET lab, funded by the ERC Consolidator grant with €2,000,000 in 2025–2030 to study networks and communities comprised of humans and intelligent machines such as algorithms and bots. Leading an interdisciplinary team of research assistants, postdocs, and external scholars, Milena is investigating how human-machine, machine-machine, and human-human interactions differ and how they affect collective outcomes such as coordination, cooperation, and social contagion. The research combines theories form social psychology, network sociology, human-computer interaction, and AI and employs large-scale online experiments, network analysis, data mining, and agent-based modeling.
