Dr. Rico Herzog is the Lead for Modelling, Simulation, AI and Machine Learning in Germany’s largest smart city project, “Connected Urban Twins”, and a research associate at the City Science Lab at HafenCity University Hamburg, in cooperation with MIT Media Lab.  With a background in spatial planning, computational modelling, and simulation of complex socio-technical systems, his research revolves around digital urban twins and their contribution to sustainable urban transformation. Focussing on the interplay of digital models and simulations of various kinds, he explores new approaches to capturing urban complexity in the digital sphere. Further academic interest lies in public value conflicts in urban planning and serious gaming as a simulation method.
