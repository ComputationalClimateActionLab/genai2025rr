Dr. Sandeep Chowdhary is a social data scientist currently working as a research scholar in the Sustainable Service Systems Research Group of the IIASA Energy, Climate, and Environment Program.

He works on the LowAI project where he uses large language models (LLMs) and machine learning to identify the social norms concerning climate change in online communities by leveraging social media data from platforms such as Reddit and Facebook. Chowdhary uses his background in physics and network science to analyze social systems and drive them towards prosocial behavior. He is interested in platforms where data-driven research can incorporate insights from a networks perspective and inform policy decisions.

In his past work, Chowdhary investigated the drivers and correlates of human performance from team performance in escape rooms and success in team careers and funding acquisitions in science and academia, to performance in games like chess.
