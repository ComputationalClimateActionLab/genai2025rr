Dr. Viktoria Spaiser is the Professor of Climate Politics and Computational Social Science at the University of Leeds, UK. She has a background in Sociology (PhD, Bielefeld University, Germany, 2012), Political Science (MA in Conflict, Security and Development, King’s College London, UK, 2008), and Computer Science (German Diploma, University of Applied Sciences Trier, Germany, 2013). She was a visiting researcher in the Computational Social Science Research Group at ETH Zurich in 2012 and a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm (2012–2014) and at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University in Sweden (2014–2015). She is also affiliated with the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures and the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA).

She is interested in sustainability research, specifically in how societies can make a rapid, fair, and empowering transition to zero-emissions and zero-pollution. She is currently conducting full-time research on her UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship, titled “Understanding normative change to address the climate change emergency.” She applies mathematical and computational approaches to these and other social and political science research questions.

She has worked on a wide range of topics, including political participation, e-democracy, protest, polarisation, democratisation, and segregation, using various sources of data such as register data, cross-country panel data, Twitter data, and smartphone data. Her methodological approaches include Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems modelling, agent-based modelling, and big data analysis. However, her current focus is on climate change and sustainability research.
