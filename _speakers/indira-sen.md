Dr. Indira Sen is a Computational Social Scientist working on building and evaluating equitable Language Technology. She is currently a member of the Junior Faculty at the Chair of Data Science for the Social and Economic Sciences at the University of Mannheim. Before this, she worked as a postdoc and lecturer at the University of Konstanz in the Department of Politics and Public Policy.

She completed her doctoral studies at RWTH Aachen and GESIS, Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, in the Computational Social Science (CSS) Department. She was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Claudia Wagner and Prof. Wil van der Aalst. Her doctoral research drew from natural language processing and measurement theory to study how researchers and policy-makers could draw better and more transparent insights from digital trace data.

Before her doctoral studies, she obtained her Master’s in Computer Science from IIIT Delhi, where she was also a research assistant. Prior to that, she completed her Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Vellore Institute of Technology.
