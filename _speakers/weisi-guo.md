Prof. Guo is the Head of Centre for Assured & Connected Autonomy. He is the Head of Human Machine Intelligence Group at Cranfield.

He obtained his MEng, MA, and PhD degrees from the University of Cambridge. Since 2012, he has built an award-winning team at the University of Warwick (2012-19) and then Cranfield (2019-now). His research group has won the IET Innovation Award winner (2015) and been a runner-up in the Bell Labs Prize three times (2014, 2017, 2019).

He studies how human and machine intelligence are becoming increasingly interconnected in our networked society, which faces serious challenges from both the human and natural world. His expertise lies in connected intelligence, linking data science, communication systems, and machine learning. His research focuses on designing data-driven solutions for socio-cyber-physical ecosystems. In particular, he is interested in how AI and information systems can be tailored for specific challenging environments or tasks, while integrating human domain knowledge.
