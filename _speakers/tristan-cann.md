Dr. Tristan Cann is a computational social scientist specialising in the development of new techniques for studying the discourse around climate change in various media contexts. He often works across disciplines, primarily with the Centre for Climate Change Communications and Data Science (C3DS), and therefore much of his research uses climate change discourse as a case study. As a part of his work with C3DS, Tristan frequently works in partnership with external groups to improve their capabilities to evaluate their impact on climate change discourse and wider issue awareness. 

Dr. Tristan's research typically focuses on understanding how content in different media systems gains attention, often through the lenses of polarisation, campaigning efforts and external shocks. His interests often follow these themes into the exploration of how competing viewpoints emerge and the effects of social structures on the wider social impact of these communications platforms.
