He was a doctoral researcher in Computational Social Science affiliated to Complexity Science Hub Vienna and Medical University of Vienna in the WWTF research group “Emotional Well-Being in the Digital Society” led by David Garcia (now University of Konstanz). His research during his PhD focused on analyzing the digital traces of individual and collective emotional behavior and affective expression on social media. After receiving his PhD, he gained industry experience as Assistant Researcher at Sony Computer Science Laboratories Rome. He worked at the Chair for Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences at University of Mannheim as assistant professor. He was interim Professor for Social and Behavioural Data Science at the University of Konstanz. Currently, he works as a group leader at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. He is broadly interested in the social sciences and uses traditional and novel computational methods from domains such as Natural Language Processing to study belief updates, emotional decay on social media, polarization, psychometric aspects of large language models, emotional well-being measured from textual data, semantic embeddings as complements to human ratings and many other interesting phenomena.
