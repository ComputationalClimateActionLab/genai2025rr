Dr. Aleks Berditchevskaia is the Principal Researcher at Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design

She is the lead author of the report, ‘The Future of Minds & Machines’, on combining human and machine intelligence for problem solving. She is also a co-author of the ‘Playbook for Collective Intelligence Design’, a toolkit for creating projects that mobilise collective intelligence, which has been used to train over 370 staff as part of the UNDP's Accelerator Lab network. In 2019, she designed and ran Nesta's Crowd Forecasting challenge in partnership with BBC Future and the Good Judgement Project.
