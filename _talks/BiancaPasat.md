Pasat, 2Aristotelis Chatziioannou, 1Afshin Samali, 1Adrienne M Gorman   1Apoptosis Research Centre, University of Galway, 2BRFAA, Athens, Greece   IRE1 is a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and is constitutively active in several cancers, e.g., triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). IRE1 possesses RNase activity that can cleave CUGCAG motifs inside stem loops. Its best characterized target is XBP1 mRNA which possesses two such motifs, whose cleavage leads to production of an active transcription factor XBP1s that promotes tumor progression, making it a promising therapeutic target [2]. IRE1 can also cleave other mRNAs leading to their degradation in a process called Regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). RIDD targets are not well characterized. We developed a pipeline called RIDDer. Using sequencing data, it predicts XBP1s/RIDD targets, based on expression levels, presence of a consensus motif and its accessibility to IRE1, presence of XBP1s-response elements in the gene.    Using this pipeline, we identified several novel putative RIDD targets in a TNBC cell line, which are currently being validated in wet lab experiments. The data demonstrate that this pipeline is a valuable tool for identifying potential novel RIDD targets and unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying IRE1 signaling.    1. Logue et al.
