The Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) Ireland project, jointly funded by the European Commission, under the Digital Europe Programme, and the Health Research Board, is part of a consortium of EU Member States that will enable secure federated sharing of genomics and associated clinical data across Europe. The GDI project will develop the infrastructure for Ireland to participate in the Genomes of Europe project (the‘1+ Million Genomes’ initiative) and it is also developing infrastructure for sharing of cancer genomics data. I will describe our role in the GDI project, considerations and approaches when developing federated sharing of clinical genetics and genomics data. In particular I will discuss data sharing of genetics, genomics and 'omics data and tools in cancer.
