Movile Cave is a unique subterranean ecosystem evolutionarily and physically isolated for ~5 million years and sustained by microbial primary production. Chemoautotrophic microbes derive energy from the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide and methane to form the basis of the food web. Here we apply high coverage shotgun metagenome sequencing to the micro-niches of Movile Cave, namely the microbial mat, sediment and wall biofilm. The taxonomic diversity of these micro-niches were assessed by read classification using Kaiju. The relative abundance and diversity of biogeochemical cycling genes were determined using a custom pipeline incorporating protein-level assembly using PLASS, homologue detection using HMMER3 and phylogenetic reconstruction. Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were also generated and were both taxonomically and functionally characterised.
