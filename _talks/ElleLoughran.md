Approximately 1% of tumours have a near-haploid or low-hypodiploid karyotype (24-39 chromosomes). These tumours have been associated with whole genome duplications and poor prognosis, but their evolution—and particularly their ability to tolerate such extreme aneuploidy—remains largely unexplored.   Using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Mitelman database, we measure the dosage imbalance experienced by these tumours and assess the presence and impact of potential compensatory mechanisms including whole genome duplication (WGD) and epigenetic alterations.  We find that chromosome loss rates are non-random but tissue-specific and unrelated to chromosome size or the presence of dosage-sensitive genes. We confirm the high rate of WGD amongst low-hypodiploid tumours, but show using survival analysis that WGD is not a compensatory mechanism but a mere manifestation of chromosomal instability. In line with this, we find that low-hypodiploid tumours are significantly more likely to exhibit mutations in cytoskeleton-related genes but not epigenetic regulators. Finally, we compare the expression profiles of low-hypodiploid tumours with and without WGD to those of diploid tumours to identify potential dosage compensation or loss-of-imprinting events.
