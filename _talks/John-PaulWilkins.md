Microbiomes can be studied at genomic levels ranging from single genes/amplicons to community-wide shotgun metagenomes. Individual researchers select the most appropriate level based on the varying advantages and disadvantages of each, including specificity and cost. Direct comparisons between different levels of dataset presents significant challenges. We have developed a novel sequence-based taxonomic identification system, based on the Life Identification Number (LIN) framework, to consolidate and integrate multiple levels of existing and future genomic datasets. We use sequence similarity to increase the resolution of phylogenetic placement to suit the needs of the comparison. Inaccuracies and inconsistencies in reference databases and published studies are bypassed. Stable classification is robust to changes in taxonomy. We are developing the system by linking metataxonomic and metagenome-assembled genomic data from ruminant microbiomes; and SARS-COV2 sequencing data from clinical samples and wastewater surveillance programs.
