Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) is a major evolutionary event providing new raw genetic materials that may facilitate evolutionary diversification and novelty. The genetic redundancy afforded by WGD has sometimes been associated with survival through mass extinction events. Gene duplications in Acropora have been linked to the genus' resilience to bleaching events. A recent study argued for the occurrence of a WGD event in the ancestral acroporan lineage in line with a global coral extinction at the Oligocene-Miocene transition. Here, using analyses of gene tree duplication patterns, synteny analysis and Hox cluster copy number we confirm that there are many gene duplications in the most recent common ancestor of Acropora. We also observe this elsewhere in Hexacorallia evolution, and importantly, the duplicated genes lack the synteny pattern expected from duplicates arising from a recent WGD. We conclude that gene duplications in Acropora did not result from WGD and instead are likely due to many small-scale duplications.
