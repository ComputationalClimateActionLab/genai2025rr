Description:

Many social systems are driven by the attention economy, with rich rewards for actors that can effectively engage with audiences. Past efforts to characterise and model the mechanisms driving attention flow have seen some success, but have been limited by choices of activity scales that obscure universal dynamics inherent in social systems. In this talk, I will share novel methodology to reveal these scale-independent patterns, demonstrate their emergence through agent-based models and highlight opportunities for generative AI-powered agents to improve these models.
