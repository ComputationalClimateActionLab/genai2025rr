Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of complex phenotypes are limited by their ability to detect significant signals, partly owing to the broad range of considered symptoms. This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging larger sample sizes offered by biobanking initiatives, but studies are often still underpowered to highlight associated loci for common conditions such as bipolar disorder. GWAS of intermediate phenotypes, derived from phenotype-specific associated quantities such as neuroimaging biomarkers, would enable refinement of the initial experimental question which could increase the possibility of detecting significant genetic signals through a biologically informed sub-phenotype. This concept has already been explored via imaging derived phenotype GWAS of tabular brain data variables related to general neuroanatomical variance, but these approaches are not specific to condition in current implementations and do not usually consider non-linear relationships between derived measures and outcome. We therefore propose the use of deep-learning models such as convolutional neural networks and autoencoders to derive image-based endophenotypes of brain-based conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. We compare the genetic properties of these quantities in relation to GWAS results of the primary phenotype and other psychiatric disorders.
