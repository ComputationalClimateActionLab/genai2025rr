Intelligent Food Assurance Systems (IFAS) could play a key role in ensuring the safety and quality of food through the use of smart sensors, data processing systems and other technologies. This study provides an overview of recent advances in current IFAS, focusing on the four main components of food assurance: food quality, food safety, food fraud and food protection, examining the four dimensions of assessment and the corresponding criteria used to identify different food issues, as well as the countermeasures that should be taken by food assurance systems. This study highlights the possible impact of IFAS on improving transparency and traceability in the food chain, reducing food loss and waste for sustainable development and improving consumer confidence.
