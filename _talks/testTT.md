Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown great promise in medicine, particularly in complex tasks. However, to make significant discoveries from big data, high-quality data preparation is critical. This can involve programmatic data quality control (QC) followed by semantic enrichment, which enhances the clarity of relationships between patients and features. AI models can then identify complex patterns in the data and generate interpretable outputs. Stage II/III colon cancer patients represent a diverse group with difficult to predict outcomes. In this study, we used advanced AI models, specifically variational deep autoencoders (VAEs), along with data preparation tools to identify new patient cohorts. Our QC methods resulted in a consistent and accurate numeric dataset suitable for AI application, while semantic enrichment incorporated semantic relationships from medical ontologies. We used VAEs to reduce dimensionality and clustered patients into distinct cohorts, and we also employed model interpretation methods to understand which features were driving the model's predictions. Our findings demonstrate that these methods can effectively identify patient cohorts within complex medical datasets, providing insights into aetiology and treatment decisions. Additionally, prognostic stratification accuracy can be improved within cohorts due to similarities in disease mechanisms.
