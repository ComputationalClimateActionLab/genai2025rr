All vertebrate genomes are impacted by multiple rounds of ancestral polyploidisation that have shaped their structure, organisation, and function. Genes arising from these events, termed ohnologs, amount to 20-35% of the human genome and have played a major role in the evolution of vertebrate complexity, development, and susceptibility to genetic disease. While this class of genes is of broad interest, high-quality ohnolog datasets are hard to find, with datasets usually generated as needed using ad hoc methods. This can lead to issues of consistency across studies as well as an unnecessary repeated effort. Here we create a high-confidence ohnolog dataset with a focus on the 1R and 2R events shared by all jawed vertebrates. Unlike previous studies, we make use of multiple sources of evidence, allowing us to be highly confident in our ohnolog assignment. We also distinguish between 1R and 2R ohnologs in our dataset using data from ancestral chromosome reconstructions. Furthermore, we adapt our ohnolog identification pipeline to be re-usable for any whole genome duplication event. In order to make our dataset easily accessible, we develop tooling for visualising and analysing our data using a modern web interface. Our dataset should prove to be a useful resource for anyone studying the 1R and 2R whole genome duplication events or building an ohnolog dataset for other polyploidisation events.
