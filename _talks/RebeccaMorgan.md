Men of African descent (AF) have a threefold greater chance of developing prostate cancer, and a twofold higher mortality rate compared with men of European descent (EU). In recent years advances in computational gene prediction coupled with deep RNA sequencing approaches have revealed that chimeric RNAs can imitate gene fusions. Trans- and cis-splicing of pre-mRNAs during aberrant transcription can guide genome rearrangements to generate novel gene fusions. Many of these chimeras represent potential driver mutations providing a selective growth advantage thereby promoting cancer development. In this study, we examined an important segment of AF and EU men: men undergoing prostate biopsy. AF and EU prostate biopsy cores were collected from 90 patients presenting with or at risk for early-stage prostate cancer. RNA-sequencing was performed and a pipeline exploiting chimera gene prediction tools was used to analyze the prostate transcriptome for the presence of fusions. Novel gene fusions were detected in the context of prostate cancer and racial differences were explored. The novel fusions identified have potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapeutic approaches in the context of prostate cancer diagnosis and racial disparities.
