 The post-market unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) can lead to severe case. In the context of ADRs prediction, the drug-ADR data is considerably imbalanced - drugs with ADRs (positive cases) are far less than drugs without them (negative cases).  Here we developed a non-negative matrix factorization enhanced kernel regression, that can make prediction on the imbalanced ADRs data. Most existing methods reached high performance in AUROC but low AUPRC, which means they have poorer performance in positive cases. In the comparison of overall existing methods, kernel regression performs the best in metric of AUPRC but low AUROC. After a rigorous nested cross validation, our method shows same level of AUPRC as KR, outperforming other existing method, without sacrificing the performance AUROC.
