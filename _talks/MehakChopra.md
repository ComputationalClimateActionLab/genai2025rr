Aorta, the largest artery, carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve to the circulatory system. Despite apparent advancements in treatment and diagnostic methods, the burden of aortic disease has grown by 12% over the past two decades (1). Older Age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other external factors like smoking cause the aorta to stiffen, which leads to acute aortic syndromes (AAS), such as abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. An aortic Aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta that can rupture or dissect by tearing the aorta's inner layer, resulting in sudden death. A direct measure of aortic stiffness, known as distensibility, can be accurately obtained using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) (2), which can predict adverse cardiovascular events, unraveling the relationships between imaging phenotypes and disease. By utilizing CMR images from UK Biobank (UKBB), we are exploring the aortic elastic properties using 17 layered convolution method and clinically available software called TeraRecon. Left ventricular function is significantly influenced by the elasticity and stiffness of the aorta (3), which brings us to dig more to find the correlation between measures of the left ventricle (LV), for example, LV Ejection Fraction (EF), Mass, Volume with Aortic distensibility which could help us further understanding the cardiac functioning concerning the aortic stiffness and distensibility.
