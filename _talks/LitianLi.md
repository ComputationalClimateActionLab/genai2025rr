Rice grain is a staple food for nearly half of the worldâ€˜s population, but poses a potential health risk to people who consume rice regularly, as it can be elevated in arsenic and cadmium, which are both carcinogenic. Previous surveys had shown large geographic differences in the concentration of arsenic and cadmium in rice grain, most likely due to soil biogeochemical differences.  The aim of the current study was to identify potential biogeochemical drivers for elevated rice grain arsenic and cadmium, via collection of rice paddy soil, rice straw, and grain from a total of 132 paddy fields in East Africa, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Southern Europe, for matched analysis of soil microbial communities and soil, straw and rice grain chemistry. Highest levels of arsenic in rice grain were identified in Vietnam and Southern Europe and were associated with higher soil arsenic and significantly correlated with higher abundance of sulphur oxidising bacteria, sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea.   Highest levels of cadmium in rice grain were seen in Sri Lanka and were associated with higher soil Eh, and significantly correlated with higher abundance of some fungi and some aerobic bacteria but were not related to the concentration of soil cadmium.
