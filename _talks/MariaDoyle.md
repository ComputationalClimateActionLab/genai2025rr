The rapid expansion of genomics, biomedical research, and bioinformatics necessitates a skilled and diverse workforce capable of analyzing complex biological data. The Bioconductor project has been instrumental in providing open-source software tools and resources for genomics research. To further foster education and training within the global Bioconductor community, the Bioconductor Teaching Committee has partnered with The Carpentries, through support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, to launch the Bioconductor Carpentries global training program.  This program aims to equip 30+ selected Bioconductor community members with evidence-based teaching skills through The Carpentries' Instructor Training. Upon completion, certified instructors will teach Bioconductor workshops and contribute to the development of Bioconductor training materials. This initiative prioritizes the selection of applicants from diverse regions, backgrounds, and languages to ensure the program reaches a broad audience and supports the global Bioconductor community effectively.  In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the Bioconductor Carpentries global training program and its progress to date.
